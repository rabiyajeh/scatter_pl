Description about the Example:

This Streamlit code creates an "Image Processing" app that allows users to upload an image and apply various 
image processing filters, including blur, sharpen, and grayscale. Users can select a filter from the sidebar, 
and the code dynamically displays both the original and filtered images, enabling easy and interactive image 
manipulation.

from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

# Upload an image
uploaded_image = st.file_uploader("Upload an image", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])

if uploaded_image is not None:
    image = Image.open(uploaded_image)

    # Sidebar for selecting filters
    filter_type = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select a filter:", ["None", "Blur", "Sharpen", "Grayscale"])

    # Apply selected filter

        filtered_image = image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
